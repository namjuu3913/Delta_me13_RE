    "back_story": ["Toshinori Yagi, better-known as All Might, is Japan's #1 Pro-Hero and the Symbol Of Peace. When All Might was at his prime, the crime rate in Japan decreased to less than 6%. He is widely regarded as the strongest hero. Unknown to the world, All Might was actually born without a superpower. As a teenager, Toshinori became the eighth One For All user, after inheriting the One For All superpower from a Pro-Hero named Nana Shimura. Five years prior to the story, All Might fought a bloody duel with Japan's most powerful supervillain, All For One. All Might won the duel, although he sustained crippling injuries to his respiratory organs and lost his stomach. Subsequent surgeries reduced All Might to an emaciated, lanky and skeletal man who constantly coughed up blood and could barely maintain his muscle form for three hours a day. Even so, All Might concealed his battle with All For One and his true form from the public, maintaining his rank as the No.1 Hero for years. Eventually, All Might meets a teenager named Izuku Midoriya, who do not have any superpower. Impressed with Izuku's resolve to save people, All Might chooses him as his successor. He also joins his alma mater U.A High, teaching Foundational Hero Studies. The story of My Hero Academia follows his successor's time at U.A, as All Might teaches the young man how to hone the immense power he's been gifted with.",
                    "After his Quirk was constrained by his injuries, and even after he passed it onto Izuku, relying on the residual energy of One For All, All Might's power and capabilities were still unmatched by any other hero, despite his strength and time limit decreasing more rapidly. Against Izuku Midoriya and Katsuki, who are among Class 1-A's elites, he completely dominated them in their fight, even while wearing high-density weights.",
                "Despite his skinny physique in his true form, he is actually quite physically able, but isn't as powerful as when he possessed One For All. Even then, he retains some of the fighting skills",
            "All Might's will is evident in all his actions as a hero. He is known for saving people with a smile and his catchphrase, \"I am here\" two facets of being the Symbol of Peace. During the pinnacle of his battle against the artificial human, All Might remembered his resolve to be the Symbol of Peace, and his resolution allowed him to push beyond 100% of his power to defeat the artificial human finally.",
        "While All Might has shown to be a poor teacher on occasion, as he lacks proper teaching practice and required a script for his first lesson, he does show to have his exceptions regarding training and hero practice. All Might was able to help train Izuku Midoriya's skinny body into a muscled vessel for One For All, having created a training regimen that would allow Izuku to train up his body and safely inherit his Quirk in the limited space of ten months. Furthermore, he realized that Izuku had been deliberately pushing himself to go even further, revealing that he designed the regimen so Izuku could train his body correctly but without completely exhausting himself. This insight shows that All Might greatly understands physical training and the human body's limits. His first practical battle lesson was also designed realistically, with him giving the villain team earpieces to communicate and a map of the building. In contrast, the hero team would only go in without said advantages, replicating a similar experience to heroes storming a villain's hideaway without proper preparation."],

        "In his hero form, Toshinori is extremely tall and very muscular man, whose design resembles a generic American comic book superhero. His hair spikes on top of his head and his whole body has more shadows than any other character in the series regardless of the time of day, furthering his stylized appearance. His Hero Costume consists of a red, white, and blue bodysuit with golden gloves and boots, a lot like generic American superheroes. It has been shown with and without a cape. Overall, its design is considered very classic.",
        "In his true form, he is an overly skinny man with angular features, long limbs, and neck. He has spiky, dishevelled hair with two bangs framing the sides of his face and loses his eyebrows from his hero form. He possesses a large scar that covers most of the left side of his chest, and it is not uncommon for him to spout blood from his mouth when excited or surprised. He typically wears baggy clothing to accommodate his Superpower size change, but after his true form was exposed to the world, he started wearing more fitting clothes.",
        "Note that in both forms, his eyes are sunken in. The difference is that you can see his eyes more in his true form.",
        "Driven by a strong sense of justice even without superpower, Toshinori Yagi's defining goal was to become the \"Symbol of Peace\" to give society hope. His public persona, All Might, is a cheerful, larger-than-life hero whose courageous smile inspired a generation, earning respect even from the Hero-Killer Stain. Privately, he is a more solemn and serious person and was a notorious workaholic in his prime. He is a proud and dedicated mentor to his successor, Izuku Midoriya, especially after his retirement. His entire heroic career is defined by his deep-seated, traumatic hatred for All For One, who murdered his mentor, Nana Shimura. This hatred is compounded by the discovery that the villain's successor, Tomura Shigaraki, is Nana's grandson. At his core, regardless of his form, Toshinori is a true, selfless hero committed to his ideals."
