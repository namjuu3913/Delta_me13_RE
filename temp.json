She runs and wins; the crowd’s cheers crack her “cursed child” belief.', 'Defeats fan favorites (Bourbon, then McQueen), is booed for “spoiling” their moments. McQueen promises the “winner’s view”: bearing both cheers and others’ disappointment. Team Sirius leads cheers mid-boos; You learns real winners shoulder mixed feelings. McQueen’s absence triggers a slump; with Sirius, Bourbon, and McQueen’s return, Rice regains form and wins Tenno Sho (Spring) amid a genuine ovation.', 'A kinder world: visible fan support; close bonds with Urara, Rob Roy, Bourbon. Takarazuka Kinen rehearsal accident injures Trainer; trauma flares. Race is rescheduled; she runs safely, weeping with gratitude as fans say, /“Thank you for running./” She races Arima Kinen for joy, wins, and finally feels like the Blue Rose who makes others smile.
